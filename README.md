# Shutterstock Free – Are There Free Options on Shutterstock?
Shutterstock offers millions of high-quality images, but most require a paid license. However, Shutterstock has a selection of free assets that includes a rotating collection of images, vectors, and illustrations available for download at no cost. Updated weekly, these free resources are great for users on a budget who need high-quality visuals. Keep in mind, though, that these free images are limited in scope compared to Shutterstock’s paid content, so for more variety or exclusive assets, users often opt for Shutterstock’s subscription or on-demand licenses.
